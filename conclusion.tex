\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Previous results reproducable?
    \item What have we found?
    \item Does partitioning yield better lookup times?
    \item Is it beneficial to move leaves higher up in tree?
    \item Is it beneficial to use hybrid index structures (i.e.~change layout/data structure in nodes)
    \item Best case/worst case considerations?
    \item Future Work: Combination of metrics
    \item Future Work: Look at more data structures other than BinarySearchLeaves and Hashtables
    \item Future Work: What other workload metrics can be used for partitioning?
