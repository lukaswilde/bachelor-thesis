\chapter{Introduction}

Here is a citation \cite{btree}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item DBMS routinely use index structures for increased performance
    \item Index pre-configured or chosen by user
    \item Mostly no utilization of underlying data or workload distribution
    \item Except: learned indexes -> Related Work
    \item Motivation: different data structures for different query workloads (hash table?)
    \item For this, introduce concept of hybrid index structures
    \item Create partitions to create singular indexes and combine them
    \item Optimize partitions based on one/multiple metrics
    \item As motivation: GENE, starting point for generic search
    \item Introduce what is covered in what section of this thesis
\end{itemize}
