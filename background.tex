\chapter{Background}

\section{Hybrid Index Structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are hybrid index structures?
    \item Advantages: optimize for subproblems, combine to one index
    \item challenges: correct combination of these structures (e.g.~routing through data structure)
\end{itemize}

\section{Partition and Partitioning functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mathematical set theory definition of partition
    \item Adaption to key space/segments
    \item Partitioning functions for indexes
    \item Used in routing of through index
\end{itemize}

\section{Numerical Differentiation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finite difference approximations
    \item Relation to true derivative (limes h -> 0)
    \item Consistency order of approximations
    \item Forward, Central, Backward finite difference approximations
\end{itemize}
