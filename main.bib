                     random access file is considered. It is assumed that the
                     index must be kept on some pseudo random access backup
                     store like a disc or a drum. The index organization
                     described allows retrieval, insertion, and deletion of
                     keys in time proportional to logk I where I is the size of
                     the index and k is a device dependent natural number such
                     that the performance of the scheme becomes near optimal.
                     Storage utilization is at least 50\% but generally much
                     higher. The pages of the index are organized in a special
                     data-structure, so-called B-trees. The scheme is analyzed,
                     performance bounds are obtained, and a near optimal k is
                     computed. Experiments have been performed with indices up
                     to 100,000 keys. An index of size 15,000 (100,000) can be
                     maintained with an average of 9 (at least 4) transactions
